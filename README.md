## Description

- ### `UMD_Employee_Salary_API.py`
  - The purpose of this program was to experiment with working with APIs. This program uses the University of Maryland's newspaper's, the Diamondback, API to get information about the University's employees. This will get the highest paid employee, their name, their salary and their position at the University.

- ### `News_API.py`
  - This program uses a news API to get the top news from various popular news sites. This will include the source's name and a brief desciption of the article.

- ### `DC_Metro_Path_API.py`
  - This program utilizes the DC Metro System's API to collect information about stations. It will find the path between two stations with at most 1 transfer. This program takes user input and checks to see if it follows proper case conventions through the use of regular expressions. Since the fare changes based on peak hours, the program accounts for the current time in DC, regardless of where the user is, to calculate the precise fare for the trip and rough estimate for the time taken. To keep the results clean, the program clears the terminal after eecution and will leave only the vital information (lines to take, place to transfer, time taken, total cost, stations list) displayed.
